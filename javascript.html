<blockquote>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. <br>
While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.<br>
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. <br>
This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. <br>
For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. <br>
The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.<br>
